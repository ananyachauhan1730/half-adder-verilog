# half-adder-verilog
## Description This project demonstrates the implementation of a Half Adder using Verilog HDL. It performs addition of two single-bit inputs and generates Sum and Carry outputs. The functionality is verified through a testbench and simulation.

# Half Adder – Verilog HDL

## Description
This project implements a Half Adder using Verilog HDL.
A Half Adder is a basic combinational circuit that adds two 1-bit inputs (A, B) and produces two outputs: Sum and Carry.

The design is written in synthesizable Verilog and verified using a self-written testbench. All possible input combinations are simulated and outputs are verified.

## Inputs
- A
- B

## Outputs
- Sum
- Carry

## Truth Table
| A | B | Sum | Carry |
|---|---|-----|-------|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |  1  |   0   |
| 1 | 0 |  1  |   0   |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |   1   |
